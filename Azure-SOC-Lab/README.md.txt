# üõ°Ô∏è Home SOC Lab in Azure (Cloud-Based Honeypot with Microsoft Sentinel)

## üìò Overview
This project is a fully cloud-based Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation built using a free-tier Microsoft Azure account. It is designed to showcase real-world attack data against a publicly exposed Windows VM using modern cloud-native tools like Microsoft Sentinel.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Honeypot VM**: Windows 10 VM exposed to the internet, attracting real-world attacks.
- **Log Analytics Workspace**: Central repository for Windows security logs.
- **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)**: Configured to collect, query, and visualize attack data.
- **KQL Queries**: Used for filtering logs and enriching with IP geolocation data.
- **Attack Map Dashboard**: Visualizes attacker locations on a world map using workbook + watchlist integration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Microsoft Azure [VM, VNet, Network Security Group (NSG)]
- Windows 10 Virtual Machine
- Azure Log Analytics
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- IP Geolocation Enrichment (Custom Watchlist)
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

## üß± Architecture Overview

The lab is structured as follows:

- A Windows 10 honeypot VM is deployed on Azure and exposed to the internet.
- Logs from the VM are forwarded to an Azure Log Analytics Workspace.
- Microsoft Sentinel is used to monitor, query, and visualize logs.
- IP geolocation enrichment is performed via a custom watchlist.
- Attacker origins are plotted on a live map dashboard in Sentinel.

## üß∞ Lab Setup Summary

1. ‚úÖ Created free Azure subscription and resource group  
2. ‚úÖ Deployed Windows 10 VM with public IP and open firewall (NSG + local)  
3. ‚úÖ Configured Log Analytics workspace and connected Microsoft Sentinel  
4. ‚úÖ Installed Azure Monitoring Agent on VM  
5. ‚úÖ Uploaded geolocation watchlist (CSV) to Sentinel  
6. ‚úÖ Built and ran KQL queries to correlate IPs with locations  
7. ‚úÖ Deployed an interactive attack map workbook

## üß† Example KQL Queries

### Failed Login Attempts
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| project TimeGenerated, Account, Computer, IPAddress
```

### Enriched with Geolocation
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| join kind=leftouter (
    _GetWatchlist('goip') 
    | project Network, Latitude, Longitude, CityName, CountryName
) on $left.IPAddress contains $right.Network
| project TimeGenerated, Account, IPAddress, CityName, CountryName
```
